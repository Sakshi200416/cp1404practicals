# Practical 06 Reflection

## Key Learnings

### 1. Understanding Classes and Object-Oriented Programming
This practical emphasized the importance of using classes to encapsulate data and associated functionality. I learned how to create classes that represent real-world objects (e.g., `Car`, `Guitar`, `ProgrammingLanguage`) and include attributes and methods to operate on the data.

### 2. Method Implementation
Implementing methods such as `__init__()`, `__str__()`, and custom methods like `is_dynamic()` and `get_age()` solidified my understanding of how to design classes with useful behaviors. The practical highlighted how methods encapsulate functionality, making the class easier to use and maintain.

### 3. Code Testing and Verification
Writing `guitar_test.py` was particularly useful in learning how to test classes manually. This exercise reinforced the practice of checking outputs against expected values to ensure accuracy.

## Challenges Faced

### 1. Designing Class Structures
Initially, designing classes with the right attributes and methods required some thought. Deciding which attributes should be passed as parameters and which methods to include for better usability was challenging.

### 2. String Formatting in `__str__()`
Formatting output using `f-string` in `__str__()` methods took some practice to get the desired format, especially when dealing with currency formatting and alignment.

### 3. Logical Errors
I encountered logical issues when calculating values such as the age of the guitar and checking vintage status. This highlighted the importance of verifying logic within methods and not assuming they work as intended without thorough testing.

## Improvements and Future Focus

### 1. Automated Testing
Although this practical included manual testing with print statements, implementing automated unit tests (e.g., using `unittest`) could improve testing efficiency and consistency. This is something I plan to explore in future practicals.

### 2. More Complex Class Structures
I would like to practice creating more complex class structures that include relationships between classes, such as inheritance and composition. This would help deepen my understanding of object-oriented design principles.

### 3. Code Optimization
Some methods, like `is_vintage()`, could potentially be optimized for readability or performance. Exploring best practices for writing clean, efficient code will be a priority.

## Summary
Practical 06 was a valuable exercise in building a foundation for understanding object-oriented programming in Python. Through creating and working with multiple classes, I gained confidence in designing objects that model real-world entities and encapsulate relevant behaviors. The challenges faced taught me the importance of clear, logical implementation and thorough testing, which will be useful as I tackle more complex programming projects.
